Using the symbolic solver
=========================

Solving relation:
All:
    Any:
        %X <- 1
        %X <- 2
        %X <- 3
        %X <- 4
        %X <- 5
        %X <- 6

    Any:
        %X <- 3
        %X <- 4
        %X <- 5


... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]

... with all optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]


Using the state machine solver
==============================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | Member %X {3, 4, 5}
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]

Done.

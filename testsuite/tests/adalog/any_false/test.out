Using the symbolic solver
=========================

Solving relation:
Any:
    False
    %X <- 12

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 12]

... cut dead branches:
Solution: [%X = 12]


Using the state machine solver
==============================

Solving relation:
Unify %X <= 12
Solution: [%X = 12]

Done.

Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All: 
    Is_Even?(%X) 
    Any: 
        1 -> %X 
        2 -> %X 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 
        6 -> %X 


Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 6]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Predicate Is_Even on %X
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 6]
Done.

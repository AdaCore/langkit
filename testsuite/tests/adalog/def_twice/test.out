Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All: 
    Any: 
        1 -> %X 
        2 -> %X 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 
        6 -> %X 

    1 -> %X 
    Is_Odd?(%X) 

Solution: [%X = 1]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All> :
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | Unify %X <= 1 
| | Predicate Is_Odd on %X
Solution: [%X = 1]
Done.

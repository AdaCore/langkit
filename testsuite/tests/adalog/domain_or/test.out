Using the symbolic solver
=========================

Solving relation:
Any:
    %X <- 1
    %X <- 2
    %X <- 3
    %X <- 4
    %X <- 5
    %X <- 6

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]

... cut dead branches:
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]


Using the state machine solver
==============================

Solving relation:
<Any>:
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3}
| | Member %X {4, 5, 6}
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]

Done.

--  This package provides a symbol table for text
--  (:ada:ref:`Langkit_Support.Text.Text_Type`) identifiers. This is used in
--  Langkit for the interning of symbols.
--
--  The main interest is to:
--
--  1. Use less memory by interning strings.
--
--  2. Be faster when using the symbol as map keys for example, because hashing
--     is faster.

   type Symbol_Table is access all Symbol_Table_Record'Class;
   --  Represents a symbol table. The symbol table is the holder of the memory
   --  allocated for each symbol, and serves as a single access point if you
   --  want to find back an existing symbol.

   --  .. warning:: For usability reasons, we use the access to the string as a
   --     symbol type. This is very convenient because you can access the text
   --     of a symbol without a reference to the symbol table, but is also
   --     unsafe, because if the symbol table has been freed, the symbol will
   --     be a dangling pointer.

   --
   --  1. It consumes less memory (which is the primary reason it is used in
   --     Langkit).
   --
   --  2. It is safer, as long as you never store :ada:ref:`Symbol_Type`
   --     instances returned by :ada:ref:`Get_Symbol` you should be safe.

   -- Symbol canonicalization --
   -----------------------------

   --  All languages do not have the same rules to determine whether two
   --  identifiers are equivalent: some languages, like C, consider that they
   --  are equivalent when they are strictly equal in sources, whereas other
   --  languages, like Ada, consider that they are equivalent if the only thing
   --  that changes is their casing (``foo`` is treated as the same as
   --  ``Foo``).
   --
   --  In the context of symbol tables, what we call here "symbolization" is a
   --  way to implement these various criteria: symbolization turns an
   --  identifier into a "canonical symbol", which is then used as the symbol
   --  for this identifier in symbol tables. Two identifiers can have different
   --  texts but still have the same canonical symbol: in this case they get
   --  the same symbol value in a symbol table, and thus refer to the same
   --  entities in lexical environments.
   --
   --  For instance, in Ada, decoding brackets and converting to lower case is
   --  appropriate, so that the following identifiers all get the same symbol:
   --  ``Foo`` ``foo`` and ``fo["6f"]``.

   type Symbolization_Result (Success : Boolean; Size : Natural) is record
      case Success is
         when True  =>
            Symbol : Text_Type (1 .. Size);
            --  Text for successfully symbolized identifiers

         when False =>
            Error_Message : Text_Type (1 .. Size);
            --  Message describing why symbolization failed
      end case;
   end record;
   --  Holder for results of the symbolization process, conditionned by whether
   --  this process was successful.

   function Create_Symbol (Name : Text_Type) return Symbolization_Result is
     ((Success => True, Size => Name'Length, Symbol => Name));
   --  Shortcut to create successful symbolization results

   function Create_Error (Message : Text_Type) return Symbolization_Result is
     ((Success => False, Size => Message'Length, Error_Message => Message));
   --  Shortcut to create failed symbolization results

   function Fold_Case (Name : Text_Type) return Symbolization_Result;
   --  Convert ``Name`` to lowercase (cannot fail).

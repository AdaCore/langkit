Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All:
    Any:
        %X <- 1
        %X <- 2
        %X <- 3
        %X <- 4
        %X <- 5
        %X <- 6

    %X <- 1
    Is_Odd?(%X)

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 1]

... cut dead branches:
Solution: [%X = 1]


Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | Unify %X <= 1
| | Predicate Is_Odd on %X
Solution: [%X = 1]

Done.

Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
Any:
    %X <- 1
    All:
        Is_Even?(%X)
        %Y <- 1


... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 1]

... cut dead branches:
Solution: [%X = 1]


Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<Any>:
| | Unify %X <= 1
| | <All>:
| | | | Predicate Is_Even on %X
| | | | Unify %Y <= 1
Solution: [%X = 1, %Y = <undefined>]
Resolution failed with Early_Binding_Error
Done.

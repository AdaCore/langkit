Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
Any: 
    1 -> %X 
    2 -> %X 
    3 -> %X 
    4 -> %X 
    5 -> %X 
    6 -> %X 

Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<Any>:
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3}
| | Member %X {4, 5, 6}
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]
Done.

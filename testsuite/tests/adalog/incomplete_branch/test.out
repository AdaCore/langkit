Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
Any: 
    1 -> %X
    All: 
        Is_Even?(%X) 
        1 -> %Y


Solution: [%X = 1]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<Any>:
| | Unify %X <= 1
| | <All>:
| | | | Predicate Is_Even on %X
| | | | Unify %Y <= 1
Solution: [%X = 1, %Y = <undefined>]

== Missing default value ==
File "test.py", line 30, in Example.prop
    Error: Argument "A" must have the same default value as in base property (FooNode.p_prop)

== Extra default value ==
File "test.py", line 30, in Example.prop
    Error: Argument "A" cannot have a default value, to be consistent with its base property (FooNode.p_prop)

== Wrong value ==
File "test.py", line 30, in Example.prop
    Error: Argument "A" does not have the same default value (<LiteralExpr False (Boolean)>) as in base property (<LiteralExpr True (Boolean)>)

== Correct ==
Code generation was successful

Done

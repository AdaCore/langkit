# Check that GDB helpers work as expected.
#
# This is meant to be "the" big test that checks all aspects of GDB helpers:
# Langkit-defined commands, pretty-printers, etc. To achieve this in a simple
# way (i.e. not creating a big realistic language spec) we just create dummy
# properties that implement the control-flow we want, or that deal with the
# types for which we need to check pretty-printers: our goal here is just to
# cover GDB helpers features.

Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All: 
    Any: 
        1 -> %X 
        2 -> %X 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 
        6 -> %X 

    Any: 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 


Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | Member %X {3, 4, 5}
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Done.

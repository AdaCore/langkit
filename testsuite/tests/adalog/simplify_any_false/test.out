Using the symbolic solver
=========================

Solving relation:
Any:
    All:
        %X <- 120
        lt-100?(%X)

    True

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = <undefined>]

... with all optimizations:
Solution: [%X = <undefined>]


Using the state machine solver
==============================

Solving relation:
<Any>:
| | <All>:
| | | | Unify %X <= 120
| | | | Predicate lt-100 on %X
| | <True>
Solution: [%X = <undefined>]

Done.

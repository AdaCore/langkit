Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All:
    %X <- 2
    %Y <- 1
    Is_Double_Of?(%X, %Y)

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 2, %Y = 1]

... cut dead branches:
Solution: [%X = 2, %Y = 1]


Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Unify %X <= 2
| | Unify %Y <= 1
| | PREDICATE Is_Double_Of ON %X%Y
Solution: [%X = 2, %Y = 1]

Done.

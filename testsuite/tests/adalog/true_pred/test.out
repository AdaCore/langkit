Solving relation:
All:
    Any:
        %X <- 1
        %X <- 2
        %X <- 3
        %X <- 4
        %X <- 5
        %X <- 6

    True

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]

... with all optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6]

Done.

Using the symbolic solver
=========================

Solving relation:
All:
    Any:
        %X <- -1
        %X <- 0
        %X <- 27
        %X <- 100

    is_positive?(%X)
    lt-100?(%X)

... without optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 27]
Solution: [%X = 100]

... with all optimizations:
Solution: [%X = 27]
Solution: [%X = 100]


Using the state machine solver
==============================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | Member %X {-1, 0, 27, 100}
| | Predicate is_positive on %X
| | Predicate lt-100 on %X
Solution: [%X = 27]
Solution: [%X = 100]

Done.

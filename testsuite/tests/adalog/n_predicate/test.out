Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All: 
    Double_Of?(%X, %Y)
    Any: 
        1 -> %X 
        2 -> %X 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 
        6 -> %X 

    Any: 
        1 -> %Y 
        2 -> %Y 
        3 -> %Y 
        4 -> %Y 
        5 -> %Y 
        6 -> %Y 


Solution: [%Y = 1, %X = 2]
Solution: [%Y = 2, %X = 4]
Solution: [%Y = 3, %X = 6]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | PREDICATE Double_Of ON %X%Y
| | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | Member %Y {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Solution: [%X = 2, %Y = 1]
Solution: [%X = 4, %Y = 2]
Solution: [%X = 6, %Y = 3]
Done.

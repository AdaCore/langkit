Solving with new solver
=======================

Solving relation:
All: 
    Any: 
        1 -> %X 
        2 -> %X 
        3 -> %X 
        4 -> %X 
        5 -> %X 
        6 -> %X 
        10 -> %Y 
        11 -> %Y 
        All: 


    %X <-> %Y

Solution: [%Y = 1, %X = 1]
Solution: [%Y = 2, %X = 2]
Solution: [%Y = 3, %X = 3]
Solution: [%Y = 4, %X = 4]
Solution: [%Y = 5, %X = 5]
Solution: [%Y = 6, %X = 6]
Solution: [%Y = 10, %X = 10]
Solution: [%Y = 11, %X = 11]
Solution: [%Y = <undefined>, %X = <undefined>]
Solving with old solver
=======================

Solving relation:
<All>:
| | <Any>:
| | | | Member %X {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
| | | | Member %Y {10, 11}
| | | | <True> 
| | Bind %X <=> %Y
Solution: [%X = 1, %Y = 1]
Solution: [%X = 2, %Y = 2]
Solution: [%X = 3, %Y = 3]
Solution: [%X = 4, %Y = 4]
Solution: [%X = 5, %Y = 5]
Solution: [%X = 6, %Y = 6]
Solution: [%X = 10, %Y = 10]
Solution: [%X = 11, %Y = 11]
Resolution failed with Early_Binding_Error
Done.

# Test that the iteration pattern in ``Example.main`` does not cause any
# memory errors. In particular, the literal ``1b`` created during the first
# iteration used to be kept inside a local variable for which we were
# decreasing the refcount at each iteration. This caused an early free of
# the big integer, so using this value later on would cause a use-after-free.
# Here, we are indeed using it later on by storing it as the first element of
# the resulting array and then comparing it with a new literal.
